# Complete Wiring: Router, Graph, Config, Local LLM Initiative

*This template includes sections for various types of initiatives. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Context

The core components of Muninn exist but aren't wired together. We have:
- Tool system, backends, router, engine, MCP server, proxy
- Graph parsing and storage
- Local LLM bindings

But nothing talks to each other yet.

## Goals

- Config file (`muninn.toml`) for project settings
- `muninn index` command to build code graph
- Router triggers RLM engine when needed
- Graph tools can query the actual graph store
- Local LLM as a backend option

## Non-Goals

- Production hardening
- Multi-project support

## Requirements **[CONDITIONAL: Requirements-Heavy Initiative]**

{Delete if not a requirements-focused initiative}

### User Requirements
- **User Characteristics**: {Technical background, experience level, etc.}
- **System Functionality**: {What users expect the system to do}
- **User Interfaces**: {How users will interact with the system}

### System Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**: {What the system should do - use unique identifiers}
  - REQ-001: {Functional requirement 1}
