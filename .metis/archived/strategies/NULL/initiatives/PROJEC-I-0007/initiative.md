# Activate RLM Engine and Local LLM Backend Initiative

*This template includes sections for various types of initiatives. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Context

The RLM proxy infrastructure is complete but running in passthrough-only mode. The recursive exploration engine exists but isn't being triggered. Local LLM support via llama.cpp is implemented but untested in the full flow.

## Goals

- Validate RLM engine works end-to-end with tool execution
- Get local LLM backend working with a real GGUF model
- Enable router to trigger RLM mode for appropriate requests
- Achieve working "recursive context gathering" flow

## Non-Goals

- Production hardening / performance optimization
- True token streaming for local LLM (stub is fine for now)
- LLM-based routing (heuristics are sufficient initially)

## Requirements **[CONDITIONAL: Requirements-Heavy Initiative]**
